# Simple Exam Score Analysis

University courses are often split into numerous "discussions" or
"sections". For example, an introduction to sociology course may have
200-300 students, but smaller weekly sections of 30 or so sections.
Each of these sections may in turn be assigned to a teaching
assistant, postdoc, etc.

Here, I demonstrate how from a `.csv` file or similar raw data, we can
get some useful information. Namely,

- Does performance differ between different sections of a course?
- How are score distributed for a given assignment?

A simple report is presented in the accompanying R Markdown document.
